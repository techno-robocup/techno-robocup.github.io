# Project Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Dockerfile Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The Dockerfile was missing a `COPY` command to copy the Jekyll site source files into the container.

**Fix**: Added `COPY . /srv/jekyll` after the bundle install step to ensure all source files are available in the container.

**Impact**: Without this fix, the Docker container would not have access to the Jekyll site files, causing the site to fail to build.

### 2. **docker-compose.yml Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The docker-compose.yml was referencing a remote Docker image (`rotarymars/techno-robocup_jekyll_server`) while there was also a local Dockerfile present. This creates confusion and inconsistency.

**Fix**: 
- Changed `image: rotarymars/techno-robocup_jekyll_server` to `build: .` to use the local Dockerfile
- Updated the command to use `bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0` for consistency

**Impact**: This ensures consistency between the Docker setup and allows for local development with the current configuration.

### 3. **_config.yml Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The `baseurl` was set to `"/"` which can cause routing issues in Jekyll sites.

**Fix**: Changed `baseurl: "/"` to `baseurl: ""` (empty string).

**Impact**: This fixes potential routing issues when the site is served, ensuring proper URL generation.

### 4. **Development Environment Setup** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The environment was missing Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll dependencies required to run the project.

**Fix**: 
- Installed Ruby 3.3 and development tools
- Installed Bundler for gem management
- Configured bundler to use local vendor/bundle directory
- Successfully installed all Jekyll dependencies

**Impact**: The development environment is now properly configured and the site can be built and served locally.

## Build Test Results
- ✅ Jekyll site builds successfully with `bundle exec jekyll build`
- ✅ All dependencies are properly installed
- ⚠️ Minor warnings about csv and base64 gems for Ruby 3.4 compatibility (non-blocking)

## How to Use
1. **Local Development**: Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the development server
2. **Docker Development**: Run `docker-compose up` to build and start the containerized version
3. **Build Only**: Run `bundle exec jekyll build` to generate the static site

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Added source file copying
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated to use local build instead of remote image
- `_config.yml` - Fixed baseurl configuration
