Hello. I'm rotarymars from TECHNO.

Today, I'd like to introduce our team members and myself to celebrate the launch of our blog.

I would like to introduce our team members.

# ROTARYMARS
### Main responsibilities

### Brief self-introduction
I'm ROTARYMARS, who will be responsible for programming and circuit design in this team.
I'm currently learning about circuits, and I'm looking for good sites to learn from.

# NISHIKAZU
### Main responsibilities
- Main body programming

I'm NISHIKAZU, who will be responsible for software-related tasks in this team.

I'm a night owl, so I'm active at night. I'm a type of programmer who writes and runs programs first.

I'm better at science than math.

# ALPAKA

### Main responsibilities
- Hardware design

I'm ALPAKA, who will be responsible for hardware design in this team.

I'm currently learning about circuits, and I'm looking for good sites to learn from.

I believe that the number of trials is the most important for hardware design and circuit learning.

I'm sure that I have a natural talent for music.
