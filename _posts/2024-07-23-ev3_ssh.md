# Overview
Let's code EV3 on a low-spec computer!

# Prerequisites

- The EV3 has a microPython image installed on the SD card, and the SD card is inserted into the EV3.

- The EV3 is connected to the computer via Bluetooth or a cable.

- The command to communicate via ssh is installed (e.g. `ssh` on Linux/FreeBSD).


# What is SSH?
According to [wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), it is a system that allows you to safely communicate with the other side's shell.


# Let's try it

Open the shell, you can enter by typing the following command.

```bash
ssh username@IPADDRESS
```

By default, you can enter by

```bash
ssh robot@IPADDRESS
```


An IP address is displayed in the upper left corner of the picture below.

In this case,

```bash
ssh robot@169.254.80.244
```

You will be asked for a password. Enter `maker` (the default password).


```bash
ssh robot@169.254.80.244
Password:

```

You are connected by this way.

# How to run

```bash
brickrun /usr/bin/pybricks-micropython /path/to/main.py
```

# Conclusion

Now you can run it even if you don't have vscode.
