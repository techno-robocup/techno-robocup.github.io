# Overview
This is a article for free talk.
I have created a rubber band gun using disposable chopsticks, and since it was easy to make, it didn't fly far and broke easily, so I'd like to create a more durable and holdable rubber band gun using 100 yen shop's rubber and a little bit of LEGO.

# What is a rubber band gun?
A rubber band gun is a device that uses the force of a rubber band to shoot a projectile.

# Let's try it!
1. Stretch the rubber to the maximum length, and make a LEGO shaft of the same length.

1. Create a protrusion in the front side of the shaft, and make a trigger on the opposite side as shown in the photo.

1. If you hang the rubber band as shown in the photo, the rubber band gun is complete. You can shoot even if you pull the trigger in this state.

1. Finally, if you add a handle for easy holding, it will be completed.  

# Conclusion  
I was able to create a rubber band gun with decent performance. However, I would like to create a more aesthetically pleasing rubber band gun next time.
