Hello. I'm rotarymars.

This time, I'd like to briefly summarize the results of the Kanto competition and the plans for next year.

# Results
This time, we were 12th out of 14 teams, with a score of 215 points.

Last year, due to the sensor failure and the lack of preparation, we had a disastrous result, but this year, we were also caught off guard, and the result was not good (especially in the first run).

# Lessons learned
This year, we were able to reduce the sensor error to the extreme, and we were able to finish the robot in a state where we could even rescue, so we were looking forward to the competition, but (probably) due to the weight of the robot, the tires, and the compatibility with the tiles of the competition, the robot could not rotate at all.

Finally, by giving up the rescue mechanism, we were able to reduce the weight of the robot and run in the second run.

# Plans for the future
Currently, we plan to graduate from Lego and move on to Raspberry Pi & ESP32.

I'll continue to keep the repository public, so please keep an eye on it.

I'll update the article in about a month.

Thanks for reading!
