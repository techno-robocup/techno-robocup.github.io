Hello. I'm K10-K10.
This time, I'd like to summarize the parts used in the robot.

# Progress from last time

The 3D data of the robot is complete, and the order and arrival have been completed.
The gear that will be sandwiched between the motor and the tire will be handled by 3D printing, and the one that was tested and printed fits perfectly.

## Microcontroller

### [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.marutsu.co.jp/pc/i/2782704/?srsltid=AfmBOoqydk9tS5XraCsqQw-dVpBfnG6gvRwokrS1R8Ei0NoOtyqtM-ZE)  
Used for image processing.

### [ラズパイ用ヒートシンク](https://www.marutsu.co.jp/GoodsDetail.jsp?q=%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%81%E9%9B%BB%E6%A9%9F%E5%B7%A5%E6%A5%AD%205%E7%94%A8%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E4%BB%98%20%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9&salesGoodsCode=2839645&shopNo=3)  
Used for heat dissipation of Raspberry Pi.

### [ESP32-DevKitC-32E](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g117073/)  
It communicates with the Raspberry Pi to control the motor and process the sensor.  
There may be a shortage of pins;)

## Motor

### [FEETECH サーボ FB5311M-360](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g116309/)  
Used to move the robot body. Four are planned to be installed.  
The gear will be sandwiched between the tire and the motor.  
One more will be installed on the top of the robot for the arm up and down.

### [マイクロサーボ 9g SG-90](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g108761/)  
Used to pull the string in the arm.  
The string is held by pulling the string while the string is loosened, and the ball is grabbed.  
We will test whether it works well later.

## Camera

### [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3（広角）](https://www.marutsu.co.jp/pc/i/2582864/)  
Used for line tracing.

### [Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3（標準画角）](https://www.marutsu.co.jp/pc/i/2582866/)  
Used for rescue.

## Power supply

### [Kypom K6 7.4V 1300mAh 30C60C リポバッテリー](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Kypom-7-4V-1300mAh-30C60C-%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%83%86%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC/dp/B017VOKS4U)  
Used for the motor.

### Anker製モバイルバッテリー（型番不明）  
Used for Raspberry Pi.  
By separating the motor power, we can avoid the influence of noise.

## Others

### [超音波距離センサー HC-SR04](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g111009/)  
Used to measure the distance to the wall.

### [赤色7セグメントLED表示器 カソードコモン OSL10391-LRA](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g130319/)  
Used for the robot's status display.  
There may be a shortage of pins on the ESP32 side.

### [波動スイッチ DS-850K-S-ON](https://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/g115740/)
Used for the start and stop switch.

# Future plans

The 3D printed robot parts have arrived, so we will start assembly.  
Next, we will continue to advance the red detection program and the efficiency of the control system.

Addition: I think it's better not to use the insert nut.

Thank you for reading~
